Suppose we also know (from data collected) the following information:\n",

For example, $(010)$ would be an event in the sample space where a zero in the first place represents no apples were bought while a 1 means they were. Similarly,  the second place is the presence of milk and the third place of bread. The example given $(010)$ represents the purchase of milk but not apples or bread.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to set notation, the sample space should look like this: $S=\\{ \\dots \\}$. However, due to data storage syntax in R, we will be storing these events in vectors. For example, for some arbitrary event $W$ would be stored as follows $W=c(010)$. `c()` is a command we can use to construct a vector where commas separate each entry. Complete the code below. Do not worry about the order in which events are placed in vector."

However, she can't ask the game organizers to share their numbers with her (because she's a buffalo) so she decides to count how many people are in the stadium herself. But counting while running is difficult, so her counts may be incorrect. To address this problem, Ralphie has hired $9$ other buffalo to hide amongst the stadium and count the number of attendees. Each buffalo counted at a total of $n=20$ games, and their results can be seen below. Note that this problem assumes that all of the games have the same underlying population distribution.\n",
