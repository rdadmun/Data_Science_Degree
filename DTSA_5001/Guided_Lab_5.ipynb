    "**a)** For this problem, we will be sampling from the Uniform distribution with bounds [0, 100]. Before we simulate anything, let's make sure we understand what values to expect. If $X \\sim U(0, 100)$, what is $E[X]$ and $Var(X)$? Work these answers out on paper so you will have something to compare your simulated results to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** In real life, if we want to estimate the mean of a population, we have to draw a sample from that population and compute the sample mean. The important questions we have to ask are things like:\n",

    "* Is the sample mean a good approximation of the population mean?\n",
    "* How large does my sample need to be in order for the sample mean to well-approximate the population mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following function to sample $n$ rows from the $U(0, 100)$ distribution and return the sample mean. Start with a sample size of 10 and draw a sample mean from your function. Is the estimated mean a good approximation for the population mean we computed above? What if you increase the sample size?"
