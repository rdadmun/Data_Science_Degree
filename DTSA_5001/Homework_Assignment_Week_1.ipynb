    "### Problem 1:\n",
    "Suppose we are interested in the buying habits of shoppers at a particular grocery store with regards to whether they purchase apples, milk, and/or bread. Now suppose 30\\% of all shoppers at this particular grocery store buy apples, 45\\% buy milk, and 40\\% buy a loaf of bread. Let $A$ be the event that a randomly selected shopper buys apples, $B$ be the event that the same randomly selected shopper buys milk, and $C$ the event that they buy bread.  Suppose we also know (from data collected) the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The probability that the shopper buys apples and milk is 0.20.\n",
    "*   The probability that the shopper buys milk and bread is 0.25.\n",
    "*   The probability that the shopper buys apples and bread is 0.12.\n",

    "**a)** For our purposes, we will use a numeric representation for each event. For example, $(010)$ would be an event in the sample space where a zero in the first place represents no apples were bought while a 1 means they were. Similarly,  the second place is the presence of milk and the third place of bread. The example given $(010)$ represents the purchase of milk but not apples or bread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert into vector `S` the events that belong to the sample space. Then insert the events from the sample space that would correspond to $A$ occuring into vector `A`. Repeat this with vector `B` for $B$ and vector `C` for $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to set notation, the sample space should look like this: $S=\\{ \\dots \\}$. However, due to data storage syntax in R, we will be storing these events in vectors. For example, for some arbitrary event $W$ would be stored as follows $W=c(010)$. `c()` is a command we can use to construct a vector where commas separate each entry. Complete the code below. Do not worry about the order in which events are placed in vector."
