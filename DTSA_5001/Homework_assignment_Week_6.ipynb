    "You are a quality assurance tester for hardware equipment and been given a lot of $10,000$ nails to test. You decide to randomly sample $100$ nails from the lot and test if they are defective. The whole lot would be considered defective if the average of the sample is less than $11.97$cm or greater than $12.04$cm. Given that the true population mean $\\mu$ is $12$cm with a true standard deviation $\\sigma$ of $0.2$cm, what is the probability that the lot is **not** defective?
